## Challeneges
1. Learing the blockchain and doubt in some area:
Resolved with the help from Mr. DANIEL LEAVITT (via telegram)
2. Short amount of time
3. Lack of knowledge: Since we are just university student it did take too much time to learn but it was very fun and a great experience

Learning from :
https://github.com/Ajitesh-jam/sui-overflow-25
sataoshi filp repo
well code documentations

One request : Maybe the explanation video is not that good, if so you can always mail us to pitch the idea in person 

Some Why's

Why wellcode wallet :
    We have tried SUI official wallet also but coming from Eth background we find wellcode more eaiser since it gives us access to Remix as well


Why Custom Coin:
    Answered in video

Why Graph Database:
    Inspired from real social media sites, we have used graph database which gives very fast releated data then any traditional databases    


At last it really took a lot of efforts and lots of nights. Hope you will atleast give us chance to present ourself

Thankyou
